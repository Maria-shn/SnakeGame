# Snake Game

A simple Snake game implemented in Java using Swing.

## Overview

This Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating apples to grow longer. The game continues until the snake collides with the screen boundaries or itself, at which point it's game over.

## Features

- Snake movement: Control the snake's direction with arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- Apple collection: Eat apples to increase the length of the snake and earn points.
- Collision detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries or itself.
- Score display: Track and display the player's score (apples eaten).
